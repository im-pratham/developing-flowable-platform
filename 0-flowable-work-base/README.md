# Flowable Work Skeleton Project

This is the Flowable Work Skeleton project for use in Flowable Training.
It is a Spring Boot Application pulling some Flowable dependencies to create a fully featured
Flowable Work Application that can be built upon.

## Additional configuration

### Security
As security is always project specific, this project also contains some "default"
configuration classes to set up basic authentication against the Flowable DB.
